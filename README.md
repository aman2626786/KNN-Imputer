# KNN-Imputer
The KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) Imputer is a technique used to handle missing data in a dataset by imputing, or filling in, the missing values. Here's a brief overview of how it works:

- **Identifying Neighbors**: For each missing value, the KNN Imputer finds the 'k' nearest data points (neighbors) that are similar to the data point with the missing value. Similarity is usually measured using a distance metric, like Euclidean distance.

- **Imputing Values**: The missing value is then imputed (filled in) by calculating the average (or another central measure) of the values of its 'k' nearest neighbors.

This method is particularly useful in multivariate datasets because it takes into account the relationships between multiple variables when imputing missing values. It can handle numerical data efficiently, but it's essential to choose an appropriate value for 'k' and a suitable distance metric based on your dataset.
